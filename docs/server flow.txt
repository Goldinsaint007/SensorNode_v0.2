ESP32 IR Blast - Server

Boot-up procedure and layout:
    Initialize the ESP32 board and the WiFi module.
    Check if there are saved WiFi credentials in the EEPROM.
    If there are saved credentials, connect to the WiFi network and start the loop.
    If there are no saved credentials, initialize the Bluetooth LE module and wait for a new connection
    to receive the WiFi details and passphrase.

Loop:
    Check for new sensor devices on the network and prompt to add new devices.
    Check if previously added devices are still connected every 30 minutes.
    If a device is disconnected, remove it from the list of client devices.
    Listen for incoming connections from the Android app.
    If a connection is established and the app requests to capture an IR code, capture the IR code from the remote control and save it on the SD card.
    If a connection is established and the app requests to send a saved IR code, send the saved IR code over IR to the aircon.
    Update the state of the device and show it with an RGB LED.

Add client devices:
    Look for new client sensor devices on the network.
    Prompt a request to add the client device.
    Check if the passphrase matches the one on the client.
    Add the client device to the list of devices.
    Let the client know that it should look to this server to communicate over WiFi.

Monitor client device connectivity:
    Check if the client devices are still connected every 30 minutes.
    If a device is disconnected, remove it from the list of client devices.

RGB LED feedback:
    Show the state of the device with an RGB LED inside all functions.
    Use different colors to indicate different states of the device, such as boot-up, connected, disconnected, etc.
